**Shirpala** is a personal technical blog where I share the experiences, lessons, and ideas I’ve gathered while working with Linux, software engineering, distributed systems, and modern DevOps and infrastructure tools.

Over the years, through real-world projects, I’ve faced various challenges — some small and common, others deep and complex. This blog started as a simple habit: taking notes of useful things I learned along the way. Gradually, I realized sharing these experiences could help others and foster more meaningful conversations in the tech community.

My goal with Shirpala is not to write beginner tutorials or academic papers, but to offer practical, concise, experience-driven content. These posts reflect how I learn: by building, failing, and solving real problems.

Some of the topics you’ll often find here include:

- Working with Linux on both servers and desktops  
- Building and deploying containerized applications, mainly with Docker and Kubernetes  
- Infrastructure automation and management with tools like Ansible, Terraform, and Helm  
- Sharing best practices for monitoring, logging, and alerting  
- Discussing engineering culture, open-source tools, and real-world lessons from production environments  

If you enjoy working close to the system, solving problems at scale, or exploring how modern infrastructure really works, you’ll probably find this blog interesting.

I don’t claim to have all the answers — much of the value of writing here comes from documenting a continuous learning journey, not just final solutions.

Thanks for stopping by. If you have feedback, questions, or ideas for collaboration, I’d be happy to hear from you and start a conversation.
